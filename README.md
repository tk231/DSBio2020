# Exercises for Dynamical Systems in Biology Lecture

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/DSBio2020/HEAD)

## Introduction

This is a repository containing unofficial solved exercises from the [Dynamical Systems in Biology lecture](http://jeti.uni-freiburg.de/eng_vorles_mathbio_sysbio/eng_vorles_mathbio_sysbio.html) held during the Winter Semester of 2020 and 2021 at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg by Prof Jens Timmer. The exercises were supervised by Dr Christian TÃ¶nsing and Dr Mohammad Hossein Yamani. The official exercises were done in MATLAB, but (since yours truly has too much time and) due to the proprietary nature of MATLAB, they have been reworked to the best of my abilities in Python 3.8.

## Requirements

Due to the use of [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/about.html), users should be able to run the Jupyter Notebooks on their desktop. This has not been tested.

## Contributing

Participants of the course (and the supervisors too, naturally) are welcome to help clean up any code and comments deemed necessary. Course related questions should be directed to the supervisors.
